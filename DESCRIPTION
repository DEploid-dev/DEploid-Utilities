Description: 'DEploid' is designed for deconvoluting mixed genomes with unknown 
    proportions. Traditional ‘phasing’ programs are limited to diploid organisms. 
    Our method modifies Li and Stephen’s algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo
    (MCMC) approaches, and builds a generic framework that allows haloptype
    searches in a multiple infection setting. This package provides R functions
    to support data analysis and results interpretation.
