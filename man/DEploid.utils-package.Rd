\title{DEploid.utils: 'DEploid' Data Analysis and Results Interpretation}
\description{
'DEploid' (Zhu et.al. 2018 \doi{ https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx530}) is designed for deconvoluting mixed genomes with unknown proportions. Traditional phasing programs are limited to diploid organisms. Our method modifies Li and Stephenâ€™s algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches, and builds a generic framework that allows haloptype searches in a multiple infection setting. This package provides R functions to support data analysis and results interpretation.

Traditional phasing programs are limited to diploid organisms.
Our method modifies Li and Stephens algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approaches, and builds a generic framework that allows haplotype
searches in a multiple infection setting. This package is primarily developed
as part of #' the Pf3k project, which is a global collaboration using the
latest sequencing technologies to provide a high-resolution view of natural
variation in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Parasite DNA are
extracted from patient blood sample, which often contains more than one
parasite strain, with unknown proportions. This package is used for
deconvoluting mixed haplotypes, #' and reporting the mixture proportions from
each sample.
