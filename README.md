# DEploid-Utilities

'dEploid' is designed for deconvoluting mixed genomes with unknown 
proportions. Traditional ‘phasing’ programs are limited to diploid organisms. 
Our method modifies Li and Stephen’s algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approaches, and builds a generic framework that allows haloptype
searches in a multiple infection setting. This package provides R functions
to support data analysis and results interpretation.
